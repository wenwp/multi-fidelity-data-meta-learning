Repository for the journal paper *"A Multi-Fidelity Data Meta-Learning Approach for Seismic Response Prediction of High-Rise Shear Wall Buildings"*  



## Overview  
This repository provides datasets, models, and code to support the reproducibility and reusability of the proposed multi-fidelity data meta-learning approach.  



## Contents  

### 1. Datasets  
- **low-fidelity dataset**: simulation-based response data of 2D MDOF models
- **high-fidelity dataset**: real-world field monitoring data collected from high-rise shear wall buildings   

### 2. Models  
- **Baseline models**: trained exclusively on low-fidelity datasets for initial performance benchmarking   
- **Trained models**: adapted and fine-tuned on high-fidelity datasets to improve prediction accuracy    

### 3. Code  
- Key scripts and modules enabling model application  



## Availability  
Detailed documentation, dataset access instructions, and complete code will be released upon acceptance of the manuscript.
