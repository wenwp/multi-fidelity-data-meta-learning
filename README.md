Repository for the journal paper *"A Multi-Fidelity Data Meta-Learning Approach for Seismic Response Prediction of High-Rise Shear Wall Buildings"*  



## Overview  
This repository provides datasets, models, and code to support the reproducibility and reusability of the proposed multi-fidelity data meta-learning approach.  



## Contents  

### 1. Datasets  
- **Low-fidelity dataset**: Simulation-based seismic response data of **67 two-dimensional MDOF models** under **200 ground motions**.  
- **High-fidelity dataset**: Component-level finite element models of **20 high-rise shear wall buildings**, each subjected to **20 ground motions**.  
- **Field monitoring dataset**: Real-world strong-motion monitoring data collected from **3 high-rise shear wall buildings**.  

### 2. Models  
- **Baseline models**: trained exclusively on low-fidelity datasets for initial performance benchmarking   
- **Updated models**: adapted and fine-tuned on high-fidelity datasets to improve prediction accuracy    

### 3. Code  
- Key scripts and modules enabling model application  



## Availability  
Detailed documentation, dataset access instructions, and complete code will be released upon acceptance of the manuscript.
